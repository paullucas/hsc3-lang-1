clutch :: [a] -> [Bool] -> [a]
pclutch :: P a -> P Bool -> P a

 i - input
 c - clutch

Sample and hold a pattern.  For true values in the control pattern,
step the value pattern, else hold the previous value.

> import Sound.SC3.Lang.Pattern.List as P

> let {p = P.seq [1,2,3,4,5] 3
>     ;q = bool (P.seq [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1] 1)}
> in clutch p q

> let {p = pseq [1,2,3,4,5] 3
>     ;q = pbool (pseq [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1] 1)}
> in pclutch p q

Note the initialization behavior,nothing
is generated until the first true value.

> let { p = P.seq [1,2,3,4,5] 3
>     ; q = bool (P.seq [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1] 1) }
> in clutch p q

> let { p = pseq [1,2,3,4,5] 3
>     ; q = pbool (pseq [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1] 1) }
> in pclutch p q
