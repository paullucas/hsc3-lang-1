pser :: [[a]] -> Int -> [a]

pser is like pseq, however the repeats variable
gives the number of elements in the sequence,
not the number of cycles of the pattern.

> import Sound.SC3.Lang.Pattern.List

> pser [1,2,3] 5

> pseq [1,pseq [100,200] 2,3] 2
> pser [1,pser [100,200] 3,3] 9

> pser [1,2,3] 5 * pure 3
