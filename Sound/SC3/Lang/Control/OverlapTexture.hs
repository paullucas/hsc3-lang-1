-- Generate sequences of overlapping instances of a 'UGen' graph or
-- family of graphs.  The 'OverlapTexture' functions add an 'Envelope'
-- and calculate inter-onset times and durations.  There are variants
-- for different graph constructors, and to allow for a
-- post-processing stage.
--
-- Here the implementation of texture adds sumOut nodes at bus 0 to
-- the head of group 1, post-processing adds a replaceOut node at bus
-- 0 to the tail of group 1.
