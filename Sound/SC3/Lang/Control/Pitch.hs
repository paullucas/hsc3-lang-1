-- * Pitch

-- | The supercollider language pitch model is organised as a tree
-- with three separate layers, and is designed to allow separate
-- processes to manipulate aspects of the model independently.
--
-- The haskell variant implements 'Pitch' as a labeled data type, with
-- a default value such that scale degree 5 is the A above middle C.
--
-- > freq (defaultPitch {degree = 5}) == 440
--
-- The note is given as a degree, with a modal transposition, indexing
-- a scale interpreted relative to an equally tempered octave divided
-- into the indicated number of steps.
--
-- The midinote is derived from the note by adding the indicated
-- root, octave and gamut transpositions.
--
-- The frequency is derived by a chromatic transposition of the
-- midinote, with a harmonic multiplier.

-- By editing the values of aspects of a pitch, processes can
-- cooperate.  Below one process controls the note by editing the
-- modal transposition, a second edits the octave.
